# Khatastroffik Blog Community
Welcome!

This repository is used as a communication platform related to the **Khatastroffik** blog.

Feel free to leave a comment, make some suggestion or share your feelings on the postings and pages of the blog.
Thank you for beeing gentle :-) in using this channel!

## How to?

The communication related to the blog is done using the **issues** list above!

The articles and pages of the blog should contain a link to this repository's issues.
Nevertheless, you may also leave a *comment* by manually creating/editing an issue.

## Why?

Because of the **Information Privacy and Data Protection laws** to be enforced for the visitors of the blog!
- The blog should not implement a *commenting* functionality on its own. This would require the blog to safely manage visitors' personal data.
- The blog should not (seamlessly) integrate such a *commenting* service from an external provider. This could expose the visitor at the first contact with the blog, though without or prior his aknowledgment.

A link from the blog to this github repository *disengage* the blog responsability:
- it is the explicit decision of any blog visitor to switch to the github platform, if so desired.
- *the blog doesn't (need to) save and manage any personal data related to its visitors at all!*
