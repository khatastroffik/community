# Khatastroffik Blog Community
Welcome!

This repository is used as a communication platform related to the **Khatastroffik** blog.

Feel free to leave a comment, make some suggestion or share your feelings on the postings and pages of the blog.
Thank you for beeing gentle :-) in using this channel!

## How to?

The communication related to the blog is done using the **issues** list above!

The articles and pages of the blog should contain a link to this repository's issues.
Nevertheless, you may also leave a *comment* by manually creating/editing an issue.

## Why?

> *The blog doesn't want and doesn't need to save and manage any personal data related to its visitors!*

There's intentionally no functionality to comment on the blog directly!

This due to the **European Information Privacy and Data Protection laws** the blog must enforce in order to protect its visitors!
1. The blog should not implement a *commenting functionality* on its own. This would require the blog to safely manage visitors' personal data and comments - a very hard path to follow!
1. The blog should not (seamlessly) integrate a *commenting service* implemented by an external provider. This could expose the visitor at the first contact with the blog, though without or prior his acknowledgement. The blog cannot rely on this kind of service.

Though, a link from the blog to this github repository does *disengage* the blog responsability:
- it is the explicit decision of any blog visitor to click on the link and thus switch to the github platform, if so desired.
